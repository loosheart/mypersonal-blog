      <h3> Hello and welcome to my very own internet page! </h3>
       <p>
         My name is Lorena and I'm from Brazil. Since the first year of high school I became very interested in math and with quaratine I started to be more curious about technology. Ever since then,I started to explore more and more coding and AI. If you are interested, feel free to check my Portfolio page, where I talk about my coding and ballet experiences!
